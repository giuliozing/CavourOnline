# Cavour Online

The social network I created in 2021, using React, Redux and a Laravel-based API. The students' privacy was protected as by using official School e-mail addresses. Students could sell their books, find peer-to-peer tutors for specific subjects and meet mates. Authentication was implemented via JWT token.
This project was used by students of Liceo Scientifico Cavour, in Rome, for about a year.
